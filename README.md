## Key Technologies

Iâ€™m leaning on the following core technologies:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) (and [Terraform
  Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/) or [Github
  Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)) for provisioning
  infrastructure as code,
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) for orchestrating various
  workloads, with a few general patterns:
  - [NGINX Ingress](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) for
    exposing web services to the web from the cluster
  - Databases as stateful deployments
  - [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org) for identity and access
    management
  - [OAuth2 Proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/) as main
    gateway to protect private services
  - [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) for
    building images inside a Kubernetes cluster
- [Linode Kubernetes
  Engine](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/), a simple,
  developer-friendly, and inexpensive cloud provider for managed
  Kubernetes, and
- [Linode Object
  Storage](https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/) for storing
  data files
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for DNS, TLS, and all-around
  protection. Some key features are:
  - Everything proxied through cloudflare network
  - Origin certificate presented to cloudflare
  - Cloudflare sends client certificate and server verifies
- [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) as my main
  image registry

## Applications

As of this writing, I host the following applications:

- a VS Code instance from
  [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) that allows me to
  develop on the cloud, with any device (including iPads and
  chromebooks!). Some special features are:
  - Protected domains (https://\<port\>.\<domain\>) to test web apps
    running on the server or for exposing environments like Jupyter or
    Pluto
  - Custom web fonts through an NGINX sub_filter
  - Python, Julia, JS, and R installations for the confused data person
- [PGAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org), an excellent open source
  administration console for PostgreSQL
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for my main database
- [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com) as a requirement for Plausible
  Analytics, storing clickstream data
- [Redis](https://redis.io) as a requirement for Mastodon, but also for
  general caching in the development server
- [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) for hosting
  privacy-friendly website analytics
- the [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard)
  for administering the cluster, and
  [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server)
  for collecting data to present in the dashboard.
- [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) - my own personal Mastodon server
  for interacting with the Fediverse (open source Twitter but less
  annoying virality and more useful, insightful content)
