TJCloud is a cloud environment that allows me to use Chromebooks, iPads, and lower powered device as a primary computing solution for data science and software development. 

The stack is deployed on a simple Kubernetes cluster, with each individual part served as pods and accessible on a URL and protected by Keycloak.
