- [ ] Set up pgadmin 
    - [ ] Kubernetes PVCs in DigitalOcean
        - [x] Two shared PVCs with same volume name
            - Doesn't work, the PVC stays there indefinitely
            - Any further and it gets too hacky for my taste
    - [ ] Setting up an NFS store within Kubernetes
    - [ ] Setting up a droplet to serve as storage
        - Cost will be a factor
    - [ ] Just using separate PVCs for everything
        - Won't this inhibit sharing data?
            _ I am relatively sure the answer is yes.
    - [ ] Trying a configmap for these files
