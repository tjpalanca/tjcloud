- [ ] Set up pgadmin 
- [ ] Move to Linode, it's cheaper (presumably this is one of the benefits of using terraform so this better be useful!
- [ ] Set up some non-hack to enable persistent storage on pods
    - [x] Kubernetes PVCs in DigitalOcean
        - [x] Two shared PVCs with same volume name
            - Doesn't work, the PVC stays there indefinitely
            - Any further and it gets too hacky for my taste
    - [x] Setting up an NFS store within Kubernetes
        - https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner/blob/develop/docs/intro.md
        - Decided against this - this is too much overhead for a simple cluster
        - Reconsidering this again, if I'm considering Rook Ceph NFS this might be simpler
        - Nah this is marked as beta
    - [x] Setting up a droplet to serve as storage
        - Cost will be a factor
        - Also decided against this, slow disk for not much gain
    - [x] Just using separate PVCs for everything
        - Won't this inhibit sharing data?
            _ I am relatively sure the answer is yes.
            - Reason why I'm not doing it.
    - [x] Trying a configmap for these files
        - Configmaps are read only
    - [x] Mount volumes using terraform and use `local` PersistentVolume type
        - Need to verify if it actually works by SSHing into the boxes and verifying.
        - OK, so it isn't actually mounting automatically.
            - Let me try if I can mount it from a pod automatically.
                - Seems too difficult and kind of a hack 
        - I'm abandoning this as I don't think it's feasible.
    - [ ] Use Rook Ceph NFS 
- [x] Allow for easy resizing without recreating the cluster
    - Have 2 node pools for this production and development. To resize we just kill
      or replace the development node pool. I don't expect to resize the production 
      one, or we can just add another production node pool.
