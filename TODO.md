## Terraform Migration

- [x] Move to Linode, it's cheaper (presumably this is one of the benefits of using terraform so this better be useful!
    - [x] Get Kubernetes provider to receive those credentials 
    - [x] Terraform was quite good
- [x] Set up some non-hack to enable persistent storage on pods
    - [x] Kubernetes PVCs in DigitalOcean
        - [x] Two shared PVCs with same volume name
            - Doesn't work, the PVC stays there indefinitely
            - Any further and it gets too hacky for my taste
    - [x] Setting up an NFS store within Kubernetes
        - https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner/blob/develop/docs/intro.md
        - Decided against this - this is too much overhead for a simple cluster
        - Reconsidering this again, if I'm considering Rook Ceph NFS this might be simpler
        - Nah this is marked as beta
    - [x] Setting up a droplet to serve as storage
        - Cost will be a factor
        - Also decided against this, slow disk for not much gain
    - [x] Just using separate PVCs for everything
        - Won't this inhibit sharing data?
            _ I am relatively sure the answer is yes.
            - Reason why I'm not doing it.
    - [x] Trying a configmap for these files
        - Configmaps are read only
    - [x] Mount volumes using terraform and use `local` PersistentVolume type
        - Need to verify if it actually works by SSHing into the boxes and verifying.
        - OK, so it isn't actually mounting automatically.
            - Let me try if I can mount it from a pod automatically.
                - Seems too difficult and kind of a hack 
        - I'm abandoning this as I don't think it's feasible.
    - [x] Use Rook Ceph NFS 
        - still too complex 
    - [x] WORKING - Use Terraform Provisioners to mount volumes to cluster
        - Was able to get the root password reset via the Linode API so we can access 
        - Was also able to ssh in and mount the filesystem from the device
        - [x] Need to grant SSH keys access - done via a provisioner
        - [x] Need to avoid mounting the filesystem if it's not there
        - [x] Automount
        - [x] Ended up using `hostPath` and `nodeSelector` for simplicity.
- [x] Allow for easy resizing without recreating the cluster
    - Have 2 node pools for this production and development. To resize we just kill
      or replace the development node pool. I don't expect to resize the production 
      one, or we can just add another production node pool.
    - Linode solves this problem, no need for 2 node pools.
- [x] Add main postgres instance
    - [x] Expose it to the outside world so I can use other SQL clients and to Terraform?
        - Using a NodePort
        - [x] Set up SSL
- [x] Add ingress
- [x] Set up keycloak
    - Having an issue where there is mixed content, I suspect it's because cloudflare is 
      proxying HTTPS so the ingress and keycloak don't know that they should serve 
      paths at HTTPS
    - [x] Fixed by adding an origin certificate for nginx ingress to use
    - [x] Authenticate keycloak provider 
    - [x] Build custom docker image with keycloak themes
    - [x] Set up identity providers
- [x] Set up pgadmin with proxy
    - [x] Set up a gateway resource that created the proxy and ingress
    - [x] Niftily you can use terraform to link client IDs, making it very convenient 
    - On the NGINX config for Keycloak, you need to enable CORS 
    - Need to disabled enhanced cookie protection because IPs can be dynamic from cloudflare
- [ ] Network hardening 
    - [ ] Terraform Cloud only allowed for firewall 
    - [ ] Some VPN for local dynamic use?
- [ ] Add node problem detector
- [ ] Enable Linode LongView for monitoring memory
- [ ] Expose Kubernetes Dashboard at system
- [ ] Set up cloudflare authenticated origin pulls
- [ ] Set up remaining identity providers on Keycloak 
- [ ] Add image caching for Kaniko
- [x] Enable real IP despite CloudFlare
    - Added settings to the configmap to take cloudflare origin ips and trust real ips coming from those origins (amazing!)
- [ ] Fully manage cloudflare zone
- [ ] Fully manage namecheap domain
