- [ ] Set up pgadmin 
    - [x] Kubernetes PVCs in DigitalOcean
        - [x] Two shared PVCs with same volume name
            - Doesn't work, the PVC stays there indefinitely
            - Any further and it gets too hacky for my taste
    - [x] Setting up an NFS store within Kubernetes
        - https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner/blob/develop/docs/intro.md
        - Decided against this - this is too much overhead for a simple cluster
    - [x] Setting up a droplet to serve as storage
        - Cost will be a factor
        - Also decided against this, slow disk for not much gain
    - [x] Just using separate PVCs for everything
        - Won't this inhibit sharing data?
            _ I am relatively sure the answer is yes.
            - Reason why I'm not doing it.
    - [x] Trying a configmap for these files
        - Configmaps are read only
- [ ] Allow for easy resizing without recreating the cluster
